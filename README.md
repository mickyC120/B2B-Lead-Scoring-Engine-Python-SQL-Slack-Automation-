# Lead Scoring Engine — Intelligent Lead Qualification & Slack Alerts

A business-first analytics project designed to help organizations **prioritize sales leads**, **improve pipeline quality**, and **automate lead qualification workflows** using data-driven scoring logic and real-time Slack notifications.

---

## 🧠 Background & Business Context
Sales and marketing teams often face the challenge of handling **high lead volume with inconsistent quality**. Without a standardized scoring framework, sales teams waste time following up on low-intent prospects while high-value opportunities are delayed or missed.

This project simulates a real-world **Lead Scoring Engine** used by growth-focused organizations to:
- Evaluate incoming leads using structured business rules
- Prioritize follow-up based on lead quality
- Instantly notify sales teams when high-value leads enter the pipeline

The repository is designed as a **business deliverable**, not a learning notebook — demonstrating **business thinking, data clarity, and automation**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design and implement an automated lead qualification system that:

- Scores leads using **weighted business logic**
- Classifies leads into **Hot, Warm, and Cold**
- Sends **real-time Slack alerts** for high-priority leads
- Supports both **Excel / CSV inputs** and **SQL database pipelines**
- Improves sales response time and pipeline efficiency

---

## 💼 Business Value
- **Faster Lead Response:** High-value leads trigger immediate Slack alerts  
- **Improved Conversion Rates:** Sales teams focus on the most promising prospects  
- **Operational Efficiency:** Eliminates manual lead qualification  
- **Sales & Marketing Alignment:** Shared, transparent scoring logic  
- **Scalable Design:** Works with flat files or SQL-based pipelines  

---

## 📊 Lead Scoring Framework

### 🔎 Scoring Dimensions
Each lead is evaluated across four key business dimensions:

- **Demographics:** Role, seniority, department  
- **Firmographics:** Company size, industry, region  
- **Behavioral Signals:** Email engagement, site visits, form submissions  
- **Engagement Recency:** Time since last interaction  

Each dimension contributes to a final **lead score (0–100)**.

---

### 🧩 Lead Classification Logic

| Lead Type | Score Range | Description | Action |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------|
| 🔥 **Hot Lead** | 70–100 | High intent, strong fit | Slack alert to `#hot-leads` |
| 🌤 **Warm Lead** | 40–69 | Moderate potential | Slack alert to `#warm-leads` |
| ❄ **Cold Lead** | 0–39 | Low priority | Logged only |

---

## 🔔 Automated Slack Alerts
When a lead qualifies as **Hot** or **Warm**, the system sends a structured Slack alert including:

- Lead name
- Role and company
- Lead score
- Reason for qualification

Example:
🔥 HOT LEAD ALERT
Name: Sarah Carter
Role: Director of Operations
Company: Nexa Technologies
Lead Score: 86
